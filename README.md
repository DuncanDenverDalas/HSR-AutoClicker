HSR Autoclicker

!!! WARNING !!! _You may get banned. To my knowledge this software doesn't break game agreements as it doesn'y temper with ingame files, but you are warned_ !!! WARNING !!!

This is an autoclicker for windows pc port of Honkai: Star Rail. 

So I got really mad while playing this game as it was clearly just stealing my time, I tried different autoclickers but none seem to work, so I wrote this in several hours of rage induced coding session. I don't even know python. If anyone else feels this way be my guest and use this.

How to use:
* Only useable on windows!
* You can download hsr_autoclicker.exe and simply launch it, when asked for amdin permission allow it
* If you have python installed simply import libraries with pip and run scripy, when asked for amdin permission allow it
* Use tilda '\~' key to activate it, windows will automatically focus on HSR client, use tilda '\~' again to disable it, use "home" key to close program or simply close it manually
